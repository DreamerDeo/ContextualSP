# LogiGAN
This repository serves primarily as codebase and data, model for training, evaluation and inference of the logical pre-training method LogiGAN.
[LogiGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08794) (NeurIPS 2022) is the adversarial logical pre-training method with Transformer-based encoder-decoder backbone.
