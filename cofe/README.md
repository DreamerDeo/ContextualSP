## Data Description

We provide the main six versions of CoFe to help reproduce our work.

Each line in each file contains one test case with three fields,

```
{'context': xxx, 'ground_truth': xxx, 'category': xxx}
```

The `context` contains 10 in-context examples and a test input.

The `ground_truth` is the label for the test input.

The `category` belongs to five categories described in our paper.
